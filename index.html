  <h1 class="bodytext">I must say today proudly that I chose the correct profession for me.  It’s a great job! However, <span class="pro">a "World Wide Company Covid layoff" </span> in early 2020 (and work stoppage as nobody was hiring anyone then) eliminated my situation and forced me to regroup to retrain and stay sharp as I "rebranded" me for today. (I have learned website design and more.) I am extremely confident I will be back in this awesome profession again soon.</h1> 
  
  
  <H1 class="title2">MY EDUCATION</H1>


    <img class="successville3" src="images/ccm.jpg" alt="county college of morris in NNJ picture">

    <h1 class="bodytext">It's important to note that I studied Fine Arts (1988-1990) at <span class="pro">the County College of Morris (CCM) </span> and Graphic Design (1990-1992) at <span class="pro2">Montclair State University</span>, both in Northern NJ, to earn a AA Degree and BA Degree, respectively.<br>

    <H1 class="title2">WHERE DID I GO?</H1>

    <img class="picture" src="images/shoprite2.jpg" alt="ShopRite Parsippany NJ store #355">


  <h1 class="bodytext">From 2020 to now, I have been working as a Personal Shopper with both <span class="pro">ShopRite #355 </span> (2020-2022) in Parsippany, NJ and then with <span class="pro2">Walmart #2503 </span>(2022-Present) in Hackettstown, NJ. (Mansfield Commons)</h1> 

  <img class="successville" src="images/Walmart2503.jpg" alt="Walmart Hackettstown NJ store #2503">

  <h3 class="title2">A GREAT HONOR RECIEVED THAT I AM VERY PROUD OF:</h3>

   <h1 class="bodytext">In March of 2024, I won 2nd Shift Associate of the Month Award.<span class="pro2">  During that time at Walmart #2503 as an Online Shopper, I worked the 11 am to 8 pm shift and it was an honor for sure as the store Managers all voted for me to get this.”</span> </h1> 

   <img class="picture" src="images/032024Walmartaward.jpg" alt="2nd Shift Associate of the Month Award March 2024 picture"><br>


    
  <h1 class="bodytext">I am having great success at Walmart as I did when I was working at ShopRite as my past corporate training has <span class="pro">"flexed my muscles each day for victory"</span> today at store level.</h1>
  
  <img class="successville" src="images/TC_bd050224.jpg" alt="TC results from May 2 in 2024 for BD #2503">

    
 <h1 class="bodytext">I am extremely convinced my background of creating supermarket circulars in my career past translates well in this <span class="pro"> "store level setting"</span> as a productive Personal Shopper.   My knowledge of advertising that I learned in the corporate setting pertaining to items in the circular are now in the store to collect each day. While working in store, I became a better graphic designer I feel in advertising. You can call it the<span class="pro"> "boots on the ground approach."</span> </h1> 
 
 
 
 <img class="successville" src="images/AisleA16WalmartMobile.jpg" alt="Aisle A 16 of Walmart Hackettstown NJ store #2503">

 <h1 class="bodytext">For example, in the past, I would insert on a page<span class="pro2"> cereal</span> using Indesign in the flyers of A&P or Giunta's in the corporate offices.  Today, I am getting that same<span class="pro2"> cereal </span><span class="pro3">in Aisle A-16* at Walmart in the store. </span> (*Cereal location: as of Spring and Summer 2024 before store remodel that fall.) I indeed learned how to be a better graphic designer while at ShopRite and Walmart.</h1>

  <H1 class="honor2">HOW AN ONLINE ORDER WORKS AT WALMART:</H1>

  <ol class="setpslistthree">

    <li class="stepsOne">The first step would be for the customer to go online using the stores website and pick out anything she or he wants to buy in the store.</li>
    <li class="stepsTwo">The next step would be <span class="pro">for me</span> to shop for those requested items and collect them in a big cart.  I would transport those items to the proper place for storage within the digital department of the store.</li>
    <img class="successville3" src="images/TC3_cereal.jpg" alt="TC showing items in pick walk picture">

    <li class="stepsThree">The last step would be to get those items to the customer, either by delivery to their home or a pick up (by above customer where they come to the store) at a set time.</li>
